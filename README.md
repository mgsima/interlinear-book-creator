# Interlinear Book Generator

This project provides a tool to generate interlinear books, which are books with original text and line-by-line translations. It's particularly useful for language learners who want to read literature in the original language with a handy translation available.

## Features

- Extract unique words from a text file.
- Translate words and store translations in a database.
- Generate an HTML file with the interlinear text.
- Convert the HTML file to an ebook format (e.g., .azw3).
